      "armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \n",
      "stories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \n",
      "armageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \n",
      "but i loved every freaking minute of it . \n",
      "believe me , i'm just as shocked as you are . \n",
      "hell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . \n",
      "the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \n",
      "i'm sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \n",
      "isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie . \n",
      "it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \n",
      "i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year . \n",
      "neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \n",
      "of course , you all know the story . \n",
      "when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \n",
      "in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \n",
      "belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's . \n",
      "also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \n",
      "he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \n",
      "then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \n",
      "basically , that's about it . \n",
      "as i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \n",
      "it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \n",
      "case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \n",
      "another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \n",
      "how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \n",
      "want another one ? \n",
      "okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \n",
      "did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \n",
      "but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies . \n",
      "and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \n",
      "so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out . \n",
      "\n",
      "0\n",
      "at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . \n",
      "now my view has completely changed . \n",
      "it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . \n",
      "the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . \n",
      "they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . \n",
      "of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . \n",
      "thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . \n",
      "the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . \n",
      "i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny . \n",
      "all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . \n",
      "one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . \n",
      "creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . \n",
      "a person can only take so much . \n",
      "we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . \n",
      "it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . \n",
      "it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . \n",
      "speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . \n",
      "sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . \n",
      "it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . \n",
      "it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . \n",
      "alan rickman however was not so lucky . \n",
      "after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . \n",
      "it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . \n",
      "when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . \n",
      "like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . \n",
      "times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . \n",
      "when will it stop ? \n",
      "i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . \n",
      "it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . \n",
      "is that too much to ask ? \n",
      "obviously it is . \n",
      "when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . \n",
      "aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre . \n",
      "it's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining . \n",
      "the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond . \n",
